DBA
===
This repository includes a C++ implementation of Dynamic Time Warping Barycenter Averaging (DBA) based on the work of Francois Petitjean ([1],https://github.com/fpetitjean/DBA.git). The implementation was used to perform experiments on the M5 [2] and UCR [3] data sets for the work of anonymous author(s) [4]. For details on how the algorithm works and what it can be used for, please check the references.
